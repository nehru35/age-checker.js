# Age Checker

This repository is the resolution of a challenge that was passed to me during my JavaScript Fundamentals course.


The challenge is:
- [x] Create a web page that reads the user's year of birth and gender
- [x] Create a script that gets the current year on the user's computer, print the current age on the screen.

Reminder:
- [x] Return an error message if user does not enter age
- [x] Return an error message if the birth year is greater than the current year
